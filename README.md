# A list of C Quests I have passed for my studies

## Quest01

C is not easy because you have to handle types and memory but being an expert in those two areas will give you a very powerful advantage.

This quest will lead you to the basic C syntax (variable, if, while-loop, functions and ASCII)
You will use your first System Call: write().

## Quest02

What is a pointer?

A variable which contain the address of another variable.

Objective of this quest is to discover pointers and starting to have some experience with pointers.
We will also do some loop. :)

## Quest03

Let's practice.

We will proceed to rebuild some of the C library function to understand how they work.

Objective:
More pointers, more loops, more string and a beginning of struct. :-)

Complexity will be one loop with multiple variables.
strstr is specially you will touch the one loop with one nested loop. :-)

Last notion is struct, it's a big box of variables :-)

## Quest04

Malloc in C

## Quest05

Objective is to be more expert with find and discover -type file option, globing (* replace any characters...) and --exec to be able to run another command. (for example basename :D)
Finally, pipe (|) let's you chain command.
